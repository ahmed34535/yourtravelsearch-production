# Payment Integration Services

This folder contains all payment processing and 3D Secure authentication logic, completely isolated from the main demo application.

## Architecture

- **Modular Design**: Clean separation between demo UI and payment processing
- **Industry Standards**: Following PCI DSS compliance patterns and secure coding practices
- **Stability First**: Comprehensive error handling and fallback mechanisms
- **Production Ready**: Built for seamless integration when API keys are approved
